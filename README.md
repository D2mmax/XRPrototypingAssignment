# XRPrototypingAssignment
For my Assignment i have chosen the development goal "LIFE BELOW WATER"
 I plan to use either a quest 3 with the Xr prototyping toolkit  or if that doesnt work out i plan to make an ar app for mobile
 The scene will be an underwater scene that transitions between two stages.
 At first the player can swim arround by imatating breath stroke with their hand controllers,  theres lots of fish and the sun is shining above the surface,  the fish will have a simple ai script that moves them around in groups and reacts and swims away from the player if it comes close.
 Over time you will notice that different plastic trash is starting to float down from the surface, cover the surface aswell, eventually there will be so much trash that  the surface is completly covered and almost no light comes through.
 this can be done with a script that spawns different game objects (trash) at a set spawn rate and randomised spawn location, the spawn rate will increase over time.
 i could also create a bubble particle system, and breathing sound effects.
 the underwater effect can be achieved with a shader


 I will be doing this project solo.

 the project is slighly different than what i planned intitally,
 you can swim around using the sea scooter, hold it using the 2 grab buttons on your hands and accelerate using the triggers, you can use the right joystick to rotate camera, to collect trash pick it up then reach over your shoulder and drop it as if ur putting it in a backpack, if your controller vibrates its been collected, the sea scooter also vibrates when being used, also there is sound for the seascooter and underwater ambiance, the sound wasnt recorded in the video, wasnt pickinged up by recording software.
